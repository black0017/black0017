**Why statement**

I believe in/that:
- sharing AI research experiences with blogs & open-source.
- engineering is the big bottleneck of deep learning.
- creating useful **human-centered** AI solutions.

**Who am I?**

I tend to love minimalism, simplicity and honesty. In sociatey terms, I am an Electrical and Biomedical Engineer (MEng + MSc) that is interested in the  development of **human-centered AI**. 

- PhD Researcher at HHU (University of Dusseldorf) focused on self-supervised representation learning and medical imaging.
- AI Science writer at [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/)
- Previous AI research projects that I consciously participated include radiotherapy research for people with cancer (2020), [Greek Sign Language solution systems](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%8E.html) (2019) and [educational games for people with disabilities](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/MaTHiSiS.html) (2018).

**Research Interests** 

My AI research interests include 3D medical imaging, image and video analysis, graph-based deep learning models, and generative deep learning.
