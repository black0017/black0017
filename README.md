**Why statement**

- I believe in sharing our AI research experiences via open-source and writing, so we can help each other exploit the great potential of AI together. 
- I believe that engineering is the big bottleneck of deep learning. That is why I try to advance my engineering skills to create useful human-centered AI solutions.

**Who am I?**

First of all, I love minimalism, simplicity and honesty. In sociatey terms, I am an Electrical and Biomedical Engineer (MEng + MSc) that is interested in the  development of **human-centered AI solutions**. 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a Machine learning research engineer applied to radiotherapy for people with cancer at INSA. The project aims to help radiation oncologists to predict if it is necessary and when to make a new treatment plan during the therapy course. We formulate the radiotherapy process as a sequence prediction problem and we are interested to provide novel solutions in the following tasks: 2D/3D sequence prediction, 2D/3D medical image interpolation, 2D/3D conditional medical image generation, 2D/3D tumor and organ segmentation in CT scans  

- ðŸŒ± Previous research projects that I consciously participated include [Greek Sign Language solution systems](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%8E.html) (2019) and [educational games for people with disabilities](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/MaTHiSiS.html) (2018).

**Research Interests** 

My AI research interests include 3D medical imaging, image and video analysis, graph-based deep learning models, and generative deep learning.
