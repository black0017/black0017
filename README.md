**Who am I?**

Hi there, I'm Nikolas, born and raised in a small village in northern Greece. I've lived in three countries (Greece, France, and Germany) and travelled in more than 20. I love minimalism, outdoor activities, and hands-on AI projects. I have recently finished my Ph.D. at the University of Düsseldorf (02/2026). I previously studied electrical engineering and computer science in Greece, and I did my MSc in biomedical engineering. My main interests include generative AI, representation learning, multimodal learning, computer vision, pretraining, and fine-tuning AI models.
