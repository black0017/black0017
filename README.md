I tend to love minimalism, simplicity, and honesty. In social terms, I am an Electrical and Biomedical Engineer (MEng + MSc) that is interested in the  development of **human-centered AI**. 
- Currently conducting my Ph.D. research at HHU (University of Dusseldorf) focused on self-supervised representation learning and medical imaging.
- AI Science writer at [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/)
- Previous AI research projects that I consciously participated in include radiotherapy research for people with cancer (2020), [Greek Sign Language solution systems](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%8E.html) (2019) and [educational games for people with disabilities](https://www.iti.gr/iti/projects/MaTHiSiS.html) (2018).
