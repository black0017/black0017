### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !

**Why statement**

- I believe in sharing our AI research experiences via open-source and writing, so we can help each other exploit the great potential of AI together. 
- I believe that engineering is the big bottleneck of deep learning. That is why I try to advance my engineering skills to create useful human-centered AI solutions to make our lives better.

**Who am I**

First of all, I love minimalism, simplicity and honesty. In sociatey terms, I am an Electrical and Biomedical Engineer (MEng + MSc) that is interested in the  development of **human-centered AI solutions**. 

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a  Machine learning research engineer applied to radiotherapy for people with cancer at INSA. The project aims to help radiation oncologists to predict if it is necessary and when to make a new treatment plan during the therapy course.  

- ðŸŒ± Previous research projects that I consciously participated include Greek Sign Language solution systems (2019) and educational games for people with disabilities (2018).

**Research Interests** 

My AI research interests include 
- 3D medical imaging, 
- image and video analysis
- graph-based deep learning models
- generative deep learning

**Core projects**

- Creator of the [MedicalZoo](https://github.com/black0017/MedicalZooPytorch) PyTorch library that provides out of the box state of the art 3D segmentation models
- First author of "Multi-view adaptive graph convolutions for graph classification" ECCV 2020.
- AI science writer and co-founder at [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/)
